# Masterplan

## Building and running it

Prerequisites - you'll need to have Visual Studio installed (community edition is fine).

To build Masterplan:

* Open `Masterplan.sln` in Visual Studio
* There should be two projects - `Masterplan` and `Utils`, both of which target the 3.5 version of the .NET framework
* Build the solution (F6)

Bear in mind that every time you build Masterplan, the library files are copied from `./Libraries` into the output folder, so any changes you make to these libraries won't be retained.
